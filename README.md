# alphafold3_pairformer_demo

These are demonstration programs that replicate certain functionalities of the Pairformer module within the Alpha Fold 3 architecture, specifically focusing on "triangle attention." The document explains both outgoing and incoming triangle updates through Python simulation scripts, aiming to mimic the complex protein folding interactions modeled by Alpha Fold 3.

Ttwo separate Python scripts are available: one for outgoing edges and another for incoming edges. These scripts are designed to demonstrate how different tokens (proteins or amino acids) influence each other in the protein folding process modeled by Alpha Fold 3.

Core Logic of Triangle Updates:
For outgoing edges, the program processes the interactions where a token pair influences other tokens based on predefined transformations.
For incoming edges, the operations are mirrored to reflect how each token pair is influenced by other tokens.
Technical Details:
Both scripts use three-dimensional tensors a, b, and g to simulate transformation matrices and gating mechanisms that dictate the interaction dynamics among tokens.
The programs iterate through these tensors to apply the triangle update logic based on element-wise multiplication and aggregation operations, subsequently gated by the matrix g.
Goals: The primary goal is to simplify and explain how transformations and interactions within the Pairformer component of Alpha Fold 3 contribute to its ability to predict protein structures.
Evaluation and Questions: The document also poses questions about whether the programs correctly implement the intended algorithms and matches the conceptual diagrams provided in the original scientific discussions of Alpha Fold 3.
